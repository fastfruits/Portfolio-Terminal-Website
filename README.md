# Portfolio Website Project

## Project Description

This project is a portfolio website designed to look and function like a terminal interface. The goal was to create a unique and interactive experience for visitors, showcasing my web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below is a detailed explanation of how each technology was utilized to achieve this terminal-like aesthetic and functionality.

### HTML

HTML was used to structure the content of the website. The main elements include:

- **Banner Section**: Contains the title and introductory message.
- **Command Input Area**: A text input field where users can type commands.
- **Output Area**: A section where the results of the commands typed by the user are displayed.

### CSS

CSS was used to style the website and create the terminal-like appearance. Key styling elements include:

- **Terminal Window**: The main container styled to look like a terminal window with a dark background, light text, and a fixed-width font.
- **Command Line Interface**: The input field and output area are styled to mimic a real terminal.
- **Animations**: Subtle animations and transitions to enhance the user experience, such as blinking cursor and smooth scrolling.

### JavaScript

JavaScript was employed to bring interactivity and functionality to the website. Key functionalities implemented with JavaScript include:

- **Command Handling**: Capturing and processing user input to mimic terminal commands. This includes recognizing commands like `help`, `whois`, `projects`, etc., and displaying corresponding outputs.
- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Fetching and displaying content dynamically based on the commands entered by the user.
- **Command History**: Allowing users to navigate through their previous commands using the up and down arrow keys.
- **Auto-scroll**: Ensuring the terminal window scrolls automatically as new output is added, maintaining the look and feel of a real terminal.

### How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fastfruits/Website.git
   ```
2. **Open the `index.html` file in your web browser**:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

### Future Enhancements

- **Additional Commands**: Adding more commands to display additional information or perform more complex actions.
- **Theming Options**: Allowing users to switch between different terminal themes.
