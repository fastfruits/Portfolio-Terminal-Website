                This project was one of my very first 2D Java coded games and it was for my AP Computer Science class so it holds a very special place in my showcase!

                This was one of my first voyages into a math heavy program that had a functional use and I went above and beyond the requirements set by my teacher

                This was the program I built for my school's Coding Club Hack-A-Thon in which the theme was Tests and with this program
                I won the Hack-A-Thon. It was written in Java with the Java built in GUI framework and based largely off of the HumanBenchMarkTest website.

            <td>
                This was a game that I built for my school's Coding Club GameJam in which the theme was time and I once again won the GameJam
                with this project. It was written in  Java and this was my first very in-depth dive in Java game design and programming techniques
                like delta time, game loop, and drawing to screen.
