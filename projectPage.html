                    Maze Game
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            This project was one of my very first 2D Java coded games and it was for my AP Computer Science class so it holds a very special place in my showcase!

                            This was one of my first voyages into a math heavy program that had a functional use and I went above and beyond the requirements set by my teacher
