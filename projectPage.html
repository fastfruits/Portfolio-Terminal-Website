                This was the program I built for my school's Coding Club Hack-A-Thon in which the theme was Tests and with this program
                I won the Hack-A-Thon. It was written in Java with the Java built in GUI framework and based largely off of the HumanBenchMarkTest website.

                like delta time, game loop, and drawing to screen.
